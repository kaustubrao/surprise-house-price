## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The objective is to build a model to predict housing prices.
- The company wants to know what variables are important in predicting house prices as well as how well they predict price
- A training dataset was provided with a data dictionary - house prices as well as predictor variables are present in the dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Variables related to size of house, quality/condition of house and age of house were most important in predicting the sale price
- R-squared of ~84% was achieved, which is fairly good

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
